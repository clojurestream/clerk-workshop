;; Use `clerk/build!` to create a static build for the exercises
;; you've just produced.

;; Hint: you might want to use `user/paths` and add your call to
;; `clerk/build!` inside the comment so it doesn't trigger itself.

;; If you want, add a custom index in a second step play with options
;; like `:bundle`.

;; Also try calling this from the Clojure CLI directly using the
;; `:nextjournal/clerk` alias.
