# Clerk Workshop
Clerk is an open source programmer's assistant for Clojure that combines the advantages of notebooks like Jupyter, Smalltalk-style Moldable Development, and using one's favorite editor.

## System Requirements

Before the workshop, please make sure you've cloned this repo.

For interactive development, it is recommended you let your editor
start the project (`jack-in`), if asked you should select `deps.edn` as
the project type. Your browser should then show Clerk's welcome page.

We also recommend setting up a ðŸ”ª [hotkey in your
editor](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk#editor-workflow). If the
editor you're using, isn't on the list, please let us know on the
Slack.

Without a hotkey, you should start Clerk with a file watcher. Open
`user.clj` and evaluate the first form in the comment block to start
Clerk with a file watcher.

If you can't get `jack-in` to work, please reach out before the
workshop, we're happy to help.

Thank you, looking forward to see you all Wednesday!
